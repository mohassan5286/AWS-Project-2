# Handwritten Digit Classifier
This repository contains the second project I completed as part of the AWS scholarship program. In this project, I built a Handwritten Digit Classifier using PyTorch, achieving an impressive accuracy of 97.38%. The project was reviewed and approved by an AWS expert machine learning engineer.

### Key Highlights:
  1. PyTorch Mastery: Developed a deep understanding of PyTorch and its application in building neural networks.
  2. Data Transformation: Applied various data transformations to enhance model performance.
  3. Custom Neural Network: Designed, built, and trained a neural network from scratch to classify handwritten digits.
  4. Overfitting Prevention: Implemented techniques such as early stopping to effectively prevent overfitting.
